<p>It is time to set off on our journey to deliver the medicine! For the next few tasks, you will be responsible for recording the accurate velocity, acceleration, and position of your medical truck as it makes its journey in time.</p>

<p>In this first step, your truck will be driving through farmland. This portion of your journey may be delayed as you must maintain a reduced speed as you pass due to hazards such as animal crossings. In this model building task, you will analyze the time needed to pass the farm. To help with this process, you may use cone objects</p>

                <li>- Initialize the necessary variables you selected from the PLAN tab.</li>
                <li>- Define the simulation step of your simulation model to program your truck to move a constant velocity of 0.6m/s (the speed limit while passing the farm).</li>
                <li>- Use the cones to support you in analyzing how much time it takes to travel the distance of the farm (to the intersecting dirt road at the noted constant velocity.</li>
                <li>- Now run an experiment noting the distance traveled at different points in time starting from cone 1. </li>
                <li>- Use the values you generate from your simulation model to draw a distance versus time graph.  What is the nature of this plot?  What corresponds to the velocity of the vehicle in this plot?  Why is generating a graph useful?</li>
