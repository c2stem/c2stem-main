<p>You’ve demonstrated your ability to compute the movement of objects as a function of their acceleration and velocity. In addition, you have modeled behaviors over time using loops, and then as a simulation model with a simulation time step, Δt. In addition, we have studied how to systematically build models by combining  conceptual and computational modeling. Now it is up to you to combine your skills and to simulate 1-dimensional motion of an object!</p>
<p><strong>Consider a  bus as an object that has already been placed at a specific position (x = -57m), but it is at rest. You must program your bus to start, maintain a target speed (15m/s), and slow down at an appropriate distance away from the stop sign to ensure that it to safely stop at the given stop sign. </strong></p>

        <br>
        <p>In this module, we will not only be programming updates to position and velocity, we will need to program behaviors for Rosa that will allow her to speed up, maintain a speed, or slow down to a stop when necessary.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>You can take this step-by-step or all at once. If you forget to add a property or behavior, you can return to your Plan tab to add it!</li>

        <br>
        <p>We will accomplish this modeling task in parts in order to introduce new programming concepts into your code.</p>
        <p>First, develop the code needed to speed up the truck from an at rest position.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Think back on your programs for constant velocity and accelerating the sloth.</li>

    <button class="accordion"><h3>Step Two: Maintain a Target Speed</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Currently, your truck simply speeds up, but in the real world -- we have speed limits!</p>
        <p>For the next step, build on your speed up program so that the truck maintains a certain speed once the "speed up" behavior reaches the given speed limit.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the acceleration of the truck when maintaining a specific speed?</li>
            <li>You will need to incorporate conditional logic in your code in order to switch behaviors when a certain speed is reached.</li>
            <li>Use the Resources section on Conditional Logic as reference!</li>

    <button class="accordion"><h3>Step Three: Slow Down to a Stop</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Your next step will be to slow down starting at a certain distance away from the stop sign and given a maximum breaking acceleration.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't forget to utilize the conditional logic portion of the Resources tab.</li>
            <li>The graphic tool automatically graphs selected variables in a simulation!</li>
