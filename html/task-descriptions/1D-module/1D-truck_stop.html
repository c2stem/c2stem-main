<p>You’ve demonstrated your ability to compute the movement of objects as a function of their acceleration and velocity. In addition, you have modeled behaviors over time using loops, and then as a simulation model with a simulation time step, Δt. In addition, we have studied how to systematically build models by combining conceptual and computational modeling. Now it is up to you to combine your skills and to simulate 1-dimensional motion of an object!</p>
<p><strong>Consider a bus as an object that has already been placed at a specific position (x = -57m), but it is at rest. You must program your bus to start, maintain a target speed (15m/s), and slow down at an appropriate distance away from the stop sign to ensure that it to safely stop at the given stop sign.</strong></p>

        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>Plan Your Model</strong></div>
        <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p>In this module, we will not only be programming updates to position and velocity, we will need to program behaviors for Robbie that will allow him to speed up, maintain a speed, or slow down to a stop when necessary.</p>        <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Hint:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Let’s accomplish this modeling task in parts in order to introduce new programming concepts into your code.</li>
                <li>You can build your model step-by-step or all at once. If you forget to add a property or behavior, you can return to your Plan tab to add it!</li>
                <li>A good model is one which can be applied to multiple objects in different scenarios. To make a general model, you should model your behaviors with variables, instead of using constant values. For example, instead of specifying the truck acceleration as 4 m/sec per second in modeling the speed up behavior, use the truck’s acceleration value. If you do this, the procedure you write will work for different values of truck acceleration.</li>

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p>First, develop the code needed to speed up the truck from an at rest position.</p>
            <br>
            <strong>Hint:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Think back on your programs for constant acceleration motion for the sloth.</li>
                <li>Please note that the truck engine can provide a maximum acceleration of 4 m/sec per second</li>

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p>Currently, your truck simply speeds up, but in the real world -- we have speed limits!</p>
            <p>For the next step, add a “cruise” behavior for the truck, so that it maintains a certain speed once the truck’s speed reaches the given speed limit</p>        <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Hint:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the acceleration of the truck when maintaining a specific speed?</li>
                <li>You will need to incorporate conditional logic in your code in order to switch behaviors when a certain speed is reached.</li>
                <li>Use the Resources section on Conditional Logic as reference!</li>

        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>Step Three: Slow Down to a Stop</strong></div>
        <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p>Your next step will be to slow down starting at a certain distance away from the stop sign. In traffic simulation problems this distance is called the lookahead distance. Let’s call this the “slow down to stop” behavior. To make sure you stop exactly at the stop sign you will have to consider the speed of the truck and the maximum braking acceleration for the truck, which is -4 m/sec per second.</p>        <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Hint:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>See if you can derive the equation for the lookahead distance given the truck’s velocity and braking acceleration. If you need help, check the resource pages.</li>
                <li>Again, you will have to use conditional logic to switch the truck from cruise to the slow down to stop behavior.</li>
