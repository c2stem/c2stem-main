<p>You’ve demonstrated your ability to compute the movement of objects as a function of their acceleration and velocity. In addition, you have modeled behaviors over time using loops, and then as a simulation model with a simulation time step, Δt. In addition, we have studied how to systematically build models by combining  conceptual and computational modeling. Now it is up to you to combine your skills and to simulate 1-dimensional motion of an object!</p>

<h3>Your Task</h3>
<strong>Consider a  bus as an object that has already been placed at a specific position (x = -57m), but it is at rest. You must program your bus to start, maintain a target speed (15m/s), and slow down at an appropriate distance away from the stop sign to ensure that it to safely stop at the given stop sign. </strong>
