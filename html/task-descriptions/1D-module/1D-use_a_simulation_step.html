    <p>So far, all of our actions happen as soon as the green flag is clicked. As a means of adding more structure to the program, let’s create a model for a simulation step. To do so, initial variable creation will still happen at the green flag (such as asking the user for input and setting the respective variable to the submitted answer), but the simulation actions will take place in a simulation step that is called once all variables are initialized. </p>

    <em>Design Your Simulation Step:</em>Use your code from Part C in Task Two and add the simulation step by separating the loop component from the main block of code and setting it to begin at “simulation step.” Keep in mind that the simulation step will only run when it is called, so you must include the appropriate call to the block of code that occurs when the green flag is clicked.
