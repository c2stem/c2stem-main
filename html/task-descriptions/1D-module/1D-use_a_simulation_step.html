<h2>Group Activity - Conceptual Modeling</h2>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>5 copies of a set of 12 cards with a conceptual component on each card (e.g., truck; velocity; change position)</p>

<h3>HOW:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Step 0 - 1 minute or less - Pass out one card set to each pair of students</li>
    <li>Step 1 - 3 minutes - Students should group the cards into a few piles representing similar “types” of cards (teacher circulates)</li>
    <li>Step 2 - 2 minutes - Teacher asks a few students to share out how they classified things.</li>
    <li>Step 3 - 2 minutes - Teacher introduces categories “Most of you have grouped ‘things’ together, and grouped ‘changes’ together, etc...It is useful for programmers to do this too.  Try re-grouping these by these categories “surroundings; things that move or can be moved; descriptions or status; changes”</li>
    <li>Step 4 - 2 minutes - Teacher synthesizes We call the categories “Objects, properties, and behaviors.  Some things are tough to categorize, like time, which is everywhere.  We call those properties of the environment.  You will use this categories all week as you plan and build your models.</li>
</ul>
