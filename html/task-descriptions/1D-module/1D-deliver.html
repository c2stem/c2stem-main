<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<strong>Time to complete the first part of our journey (green) in Brazil. The truck should begin at rest on the road at the far left side of the stage. Given the map and the environment speed limits, program the medical truck to start at an initial location and accurately arrive at the final destination along the Amazon river.</strong>
