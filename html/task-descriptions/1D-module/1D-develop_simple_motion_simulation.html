    Before we dive into building models and solving problems in physics, we are going to learn a few basic concepts
    about computational modeling and representations. This will show you how to extend your Snap programming skills
    to build computational models in Physics. Before we dive into building models and solving problems in physics,

        <em>Move Object One Step.</em>
        Write a program that asks the user for the x coordinate of an object in m when the Green Flag is clicked, and then places the object at that location.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Move Object Multiple Steps.</em>
        Without using loops, make the sprite move 1 m/s to the right.  Hint: You must manually run your program multiple times
