<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>So we have been studying the effect of acceleration on the motion of objects. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, therefore if velocity is measured in meters per second, acceleration would have the units meters per second per second, which is often abbreviated as meters per second squared.  </p>
<p>Let’s study acceleration and velocity in a little more detail. The examples we have looked at earlier, all deal with an object speeding up over time. In other words, because acceleration is positive, the velocity increases over time, therefore, the object speeds up. So what would be the acceleration if an object were slowing down, for example in the table above let’s say the acceleration is -1 meters/second, therefore, velocity decreases by 1 meter/second at every time step (1 second).</p>
<p><em>Velocity Change Rate:</em>  Rewrite your sloth movement program, where the sloth starts from rest and speeds up by 1 m/s for 5 seconds, and then slows down by 1m/s for 5 seconds. What is the velocity and position of the sloth after 10 seconds? What about 15 seconds?</p>
<p><em>Plotting the Change:</em> Try another example -- the sloth starts from rest and speeds up by 1 m/s every second for 5 seconds; then for 3 seconds the sloth slows down by 1 m/sec for every second.  After that the sloth decides to cruise, i.e., it stops speeding up and slowing down. What is the  velocity and position of the sloth after 10 seconds? After 15 seconds? Plot the acceleration, velocity, and position versus time plots, and explain what you see in the plots.</p>
