<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Let’s return to our sloth! Last time we saw him, we were able to change his position by using delta t and the x velocity. In the next few instructional tabs, we will introduce acceleration.</p>

<p><em>Accelerate:</em> Simulate the motion of the object to the right at a rate of 1 m/s from coordinate -10m to coordinate 10m, as you have done previously. This time, extend the program you created to define the motion of the sloth to include the change in velocity over time, and determine the velocity and position of the sloth after 10 seconds.</p>
