    <h1>Lesson 1: Traveling Downstream</h1>
    <img src="/img/downstream.jpg" alt="down" width="20%" align="left"/>
    <p>Rosa’s boat is on a river, which is flowing at 2 m/sec (see figure on left). It is facing downstream and tied to a post on the side of the river. She unties the boat.  Will it start moving? If it does, with what speed does it move?</p>
     
    <h3>Write a short code segment that models the movement of the boat, if at all?</h3>
     
    <p>This time Rosa starts the boat’s engine just as Robbie finishes untying the boat. The engine moves the boat at a speed of 5 m/sec in still water. At what speed does the boat move away from Robbie?</p>
     
    <h3>Extend the code segment you wrote earlier, to model the movement of the boat.</h3>
    <strong>Graph the boat’s velocity and position over time up to a distance of a 100 meters.</strong>
     
    <p>This example shows how two components of velocity may add to determining the resultant velocity of an object.</p>

    <h1>Lesson 2: Traveling Upstream</h1>
    <img src="/img/upstream.jpg" alt="up" width="20%" align="left"/>
    <p>In this scenario, Rosa’s boat is turned around because she wants to go upstream.</p>

    <p>So, Rosa starts the boat’s engine just as Robbie finishes untying the boat. At what speed does the boat move away from Robbie?</p>

    <h3>Change the code segment you wrote earlier, to model the movement of the boat.</h3>
    <strong>Graph the boat’s velocity and position over time up to a distance of a 100 meters.</strong>
     
    <strong>What would happen if Rosa waited for 5 seconds before she started her boat’s engine?</strong>
