<h3>So how do we understand the movement of the boat?</h3>
<p>There are two velocities that are acting on the  boat:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Velocity, V<span class="descSubscript">x</span>-- due to the flow of the river</li>
    <li>Velocity, V<span class="descSubscript">y</span>-- due to the engine on the boat</li>
</ol>

<p>In terms of Physics, the x and y components of the boatâ€™s velocity are independent.</p>
<p>So, <em>how do we compute the velocity of the boat</em>. Given the two velocity components are perpendicular to each other, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to compute the resultant velocity of the boat:</p>

<p><em>And how do we compute the direction in which the boat moves</em>. To do that, we have to apply trigonometry.</p>

<img src="/img/tan-theta.png" alt="down" width="5%" align="left"/>, where is the angle at which the boat moves with respect to the x-axis, which is parallel to the river bank. Therefore, , the heading of the the boat can be calculated as
