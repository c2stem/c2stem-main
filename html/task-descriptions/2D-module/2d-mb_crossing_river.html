<h3> Plan and Build a model that helps Rosa drive her boat to the other side of the river and arrive at the landing strip.</h3>
<br>

<h2>Plan Your Model:</h2>
<strong>Select the objects you will need to  program your boat to move across the river to a specific location as well as each object’s properties and behaviors. Keep in mind what is needed to complete the task based on your experience with the previous instructional tasks.</strong>
<br>

<h2>Build Your Model:</h2>
<strong>In the previous module, you programmed the medical supply boat to go downstream and upstream, and you developed an algorithm that will allow you to give the correct angle the boat needs to head in order to arrive at a particular location on the other side of a moving river. It is your turn to program your boat to do so! Build the computational model for the boat to cross the river and get to the airstrip on the other side. Be sure to keep track of the data available in the graph. Repeat the process for a different desired destination.</strong>
