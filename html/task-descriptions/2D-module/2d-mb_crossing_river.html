        <p><strong>In the instructional tasks, you programmed the medical supply boat to go downstream and upstream, and you developed an algorithm that will allow you to compute the boat’s heading and speed as it goes across the river.  For this exercise, build a model for the boat’s motion, so that it crosses the river and ends up at the airstrip in the shortest amount of time. Plot the x- and y- components of the velocity of the boat. Compare that to the river’s velocity.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>It is always a good idea to develop models that apply in more than one situation.  Rosa thinks that if she uses a boat that can travel at 10 m/sec, she will get there in half the time.  Can you run a simulation with your model to check if her reasoning is correct.</strong></p>
