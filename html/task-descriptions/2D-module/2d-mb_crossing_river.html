<strong> Plan and build a model that helps Rosa drive her boat to the other side of the river and arrive at the landing strip.</strong>

For this exercise, build a model for the boat’s motion, so that it crosses the river and ends up at the airstrip in the shortest amount of time. Plot the x- and y- components of the velocity of the boat. Compare that to the river’s velocity.</strong></p>
