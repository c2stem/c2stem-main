    <h6>Rosa has been given additional tasks of picking up samples from two small islands on the river as she goes across. The figure to the right shows the location of the islands in the river.</h6>
    <br>
    <h6>Can you build a model that shows the trajectory that Rosa’s boat should take in going from her starting position to island 1, then island 1 to island 2, and finally to the airstrip on the other side of the river?</h6>
