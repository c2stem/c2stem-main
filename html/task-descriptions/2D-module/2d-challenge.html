<h3>By now, we have implemented physics concepts needed for Rosa to navigating the river upstream, downstream, and across a river that is moving at a constant speed in one direction. In the final step of Rosaâ€™s Amazon river journey, she has to cross a fast-flowing, Amazon river in which different parts of the river are flowing at different speeds. In this challenge task, you will learn to program our boat robot, Rosa, to drive the boat straight across, no matter how fast the river is flowing.</h3>

<h1>Plan Your Model:</h1>
<strong>In the conceptual model, select the objects needed to complete the task as well as each objects properties and/or behaviors. Keep in mind what was needed to complete previous river tasks to support your conceptual planning.</strong>

<h1>Build Your Model:</h1>
<strong>In the previous module, you programmed the medical supply boat to go downstream and upstream, and you developed an algorithm that will allow you to give the correct angle the boat needs to head in order to arrive at a particular location on the other side of a moving river. It is your turn to program your boat to do so! Build the computational model for the boat to cross the river and get to the airstrip on the other side. Be sure to keep track of the data available in the graph. Repeat the process for a different desired destination.</strong>
