<p>Fortunately, we have made the final delivery of our packages using a drone that was able to hover relatively low to the ground. That may not always be the case! In many areas of the rainforest, the trees can be a multiple stories high - affecting the safety of our drone. If we were to drop a package from that height, it is more than likely that the package will break apart and damage our medicine! To solve this, we will need to equip each package with a parachute</p>
<br>
<strong>Parachute Notes:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>The parachute does not need to be “launched” as they are already open when the packages are dropped.</li>
</ul>

        <p><strong>To help plan each step in this challenge task, use your conceptual model. If you need to add new objects and/or behaviors or properties, you can go back to the conceptual model and do so!</strong></p>

    <button class="accordion"><h3>Step One: Program the Movement of the Drone</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p><strong>Accelerate and decelerate the drone and accompanying packages. Remember, the drones can accelerate and decelerate by 2m/s<sup>2</sup>. You do not need to drop the packages at this time. Simply program the speed up, cruise, slow down to a stop, and wait behaviors.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>In this challenge, you will need to program the affect the parachute has on the descent! The parachutes are designed so that the y velocity of the package is close to zero by the time the package reaches the ground!</strong></p>
