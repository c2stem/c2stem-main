<p>Fortunately, we have made the final delivery of our packages using a drone that was able to hover relatively low to the ground. That may not always be the case! In many areas of the rainforest, the trees can be a multiple stories high - affecting the safety of our drone. If we were to drop a package from that height, it is more than likely that the package will break apart and damage our medicine! To solve this, we will need to equip each package with a parachute</p>

<p><strong>Parachute Notes:</strong> The parachute does not need to be “launched” as they are already open when the packages are dropped.</li></p>
