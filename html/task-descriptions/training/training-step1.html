    <p>Before we get into the physics, the first few lessons are designed to get you comfortable with the SNAP programming
        environment. The more creative you are with these lessons - the easier the physics lessons will be! </p>

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
            <p>Let’s start simple. In the BUILD tab, you have a turtle (your object) and a blank canvas (your stage).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Below the stage, make sure the “Turtle” object is selected.</li>
                <li>- Drag and drop the [When Green Flag Clicked] block from the “Control” category on the top, left side of the BUILD page to the “Scripts” section in the middle of the screen.</li>
                <li>- From the “Physics” category, drag and drop the [set x position to (0) m] block and attach it to the [When Green Flag Clicked] block.</li>
                <li>- Change the value of the block to -10.</li>
                <li>- Click on the green flag on the top, right side of your screen. Did your turtle move appropriately?</li>
                <li>- In order to draw the line, we will need to use the [pen down] block from the “Pen” category of blocks. Drag and drop [pen down], connecting it to the [set x position to () m] block.</li>
                <li>- We want to draw a line that is 20m long. In order to do so, drag the [change x position by () m] block and attach it to [pen down]. Set the value of that block to 20.</li>
                <li>- Click on the green flag to run your program. If your stage looks like the image below, submit this task and move on to Activity 1.1.B.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p><strong>When finished, click on the first button (the paper icon) on the top, left side of the SNAP environment. Click on “export summary.” At the top of the pop-up page, there is a link to your project. Please select that link and paste it here:</strong></p><br>

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
            <p>It is time to get more artistic! We now want our turtle to draw a triangle. We can’t simply tell the turtle “draw a triangle” and it will automatically know what to do. We have to give it step by step instructions - including the length it should travel for each side and the angle it needs to turn before drawing the next side. </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>- Below the stage, make sure the “Turtle” object is selected.</li>
                <li>- If you would like to clear your stage of your previous drawing, use the [clear] block from the “Pen” category</li>
                <li>- Drag the current program down, releasing it from [when green flag is clicked].</li>
                <li>- Drag and drop the [clear] block to [when green flag is clicked] and run the program.</li>
                <li>- When finished, drag the [clear] block back towards the left column of blocks so that it is removed from your program and drag your prior program back to [when green flag is clicked].</li>
                <li>- Drag and drop the [When Green Flag Clicked] block from the “Control” category on the top, left side of the BUILD page to the “Scripts” section in the middle of the screen.</li>
                <li>- From the “Physics” category, drag and drop the [set position to x:(0) y:(0) m] block and attach it to the [When Green Flag Clicked] block.</li>
                <li>- Change the value of x to -10 and y to -10.</li>
                <li>- Click on the green flag on the top, right side of your screen. Did your turtle move appropriately?</li>
                <li>- Drag and drop [pen down], connecting it to the [set x position to () m] block.</li>
                <li>- Each of our triangle sides will be 20m long and we will need to turn the turtle by a specific angle before it moves to the next vertex of the triangle.</li>
                <li>- For the bottom side of our triangle, use the [change x position by () m] block and attach it to [pen down]. Set the value of that block to 20.</li>
                <li>- Drag and drop the [change angle to ()] to your program and set the degree to -45.</li>
                <li>- Change the position of your turtle again to draw another side by changing the x and y by -10 and 20.</li>
                <li>- Repeat these angle (-45) and position changes (x:-10, y:-20) one more time so that you have a complete equilateral triangle.</li>
                <li>- Click on the green flag to run your program. If your stage looks like the image below, submit this task and move on to Activity 1.1.C.</li>

            <p>Moving along, let’s design something more engaging by adding loop structures. Your challenge will be to
                program the turtle to draw a circle, but before we do that we will play around with a few loop structures. </p>
            <p>Your stage is a 2d coordinate plane, with the center being (0,0). Say you start your turtle facing the
                right side of the plane at position (0, 10). If you want him to draw a circle that has a diameter of 20m,
                the turtle will pass through four quadrants and will need different directions while in each quadrant.
                The actions the turtle does in a specific quadrant are based on the condition that the turtle is in that
                quadrant. To help us define our program, we will use conditional loops that specify what happens in each quadrant.</p>
            <img src="/img/spiral.jpg" alt="spiral" width="25%" align="right"/>
            <ul>
                <li>- Below the stage, make sure the “Turtle” object is selected.</li>
                <li>- Drag and drop the [When Green Flag Clicked] block from the “Control” category on the top, left side
                    of the BUILD page to the “Scripts” section in the middle of the screen.</li>
                <li>- Set the position of your turtle to (0, 0) using the necessary physics block.</li>
                <li>- From the “Pen” category, add the [pen down] block to your program. You’re welcome to change the color
                    and size of your pen if you wish to change it up!</li>
                <li>- Now, go to the “Control” category and add four [if] blocks to your script tab, connecting them to each
                    other, but not to the main program yet! In each if condition, you will need to describe attributes of that
                    specific quadrant. In this case, we can use the x and y positions of the turtle.</li>
                <li>- What is true about the x and y positions of the turtle in each quadrant? <em>Hint: In the top, right quadrant the x position is always greater than -1 and the y position is also greater than -1.</em></li>
                <li>- Add the necessary conditions to track for each quadrant to the four available if blocks.</li>
                <li>- As with the triangle, you will need to change the x and y positions by a specific value each time step.
                    Let’s start with values of either 1 or -1. Change the x and y position (using the appropriate block) by
                    inserting values depending on the direction the object should take in that quadrant. </li>
                <li>- Place all four if statements into a [repeat] loop. In this case, use the [repeat ()] block and insert the value 360.</li>
                <li>- When you run your program, you should create a drawing similar to the one pictured.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p><strong>If the x position is changing by 1 per time step, what is the x velocity of the turtle? If the y position is changing by 1 per time step, what is the y velocity of the turtle?</strong></p><br>

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
            <p>As we move forward with the physics, you will be introduced to properties and behaviors of objects. In order to
            allow for our turtle to draw a circle, we have added two behavior blocks for you called [update x position by m] and [update y position by m]. Your
            task is to update this block with the equation necessary to update the position of the turtle (velocity times delta t).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Follow the initial steps used in the previous activities (verifying object selected, adding the [When green flag clicked] block, etc).</li>
                <li>- Set the turtle's position to (0,0) using the appropriate block(s).</li>
                <li>- Set the x velocity and y velocity to 0.</li>
                <li>- Make sure the pen is down prior to starting the loop!</li>
                <li>- Now, in order to draw a circle, we will need to use the behavior blocks and repeat them a specific amount of times in a loop.</li>
                <li>- Add the preferred loop that you would like to use for your program.</li>
                <li>- In each loop, make sure to change the angle of the turtle by a certain degree.</li>
                <li>- Add the two behavior blocks to your loop and insert the appropriate equation that uses velocity to update the position of the object.</li>
                <li>- Run your program. What do you see? What happens if you change the values of the velocities? How about the change in angle in each loop?</li>
